### Intro (Purpose of these assignments) 

> In this unit i'm going to model a skateboard. First, I will get started with the deck, and then eventually I will design the whole thing! Along the way we will refresh our knowlegde oof how to operate OnShape and we will also introduce ourselves to new functions in order to expand our knowledge to make us better engineers.  The goal with this is to remind ourself of how to use this so that we can combind our knowledge of code with CAD to create something cool!


## Designing the Deck

#### Description
> Every skatboard needs a deck, and so we will design this fisrt and it will serve as a base for assignemnts in the future.  All in all this was really simple, simply sketch a 2D shape about the origon with the given dimentoions of a rectangle ad two symetric semi cricles connected to there.  From there we extrude the sketch and begin to draw holes on the face of the extrude which we will later cut through.  Finall we add fillets to the 8 holes (holes were again symetric) to clean the design up.  Add a cool color and DONE!

#### Evidence
[Here is the deck on OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/b867c8594dfd307c2c9359c4/w/6b746ecde74103470425d771/e/45d1491abec527d91db4b32a)

#### Reflection
> Although I could have easily done this on my own, the module tuaght me more efficent ways to go about thin in onshape... 
> - Use the mirror function and symetrey function as fequently as possible like how the board is symetric, and so do half and mirror across.
> - Work smarter not harder, which means fillet all things at once rather than individually.
> - Always label things in an OnShape document such as parts so that you actually know what is going on.
> - Satrt sketch about origin so that all is centered to work with.

> All of these things simply made the process easier and more fluid which is always a positive.

## Designing the Trucks

#### Description
> This assignemnt was kind of split into two pieces, designing the truck baseplate and designing the truck hanger. We first created a new part and began t sketch the main par of the baseball on the bottom of the deck and than we simply extruded.  We than used the use tool to create the other two peices of the base plate by again just using the original dimentions with some small adjustmants than extruding.  We than created the actuall truck by drawing a 2 concentric circles and extruding.  However at this point we need something to connect the two since we have a truck floating in mid air.  This is where the hanger came in, and we simply usedstuff we had previously defined extrude peices which would connect them.  from here it was more filleting for cleaning up purposes and bam, we are done with this section. Oh and we assigned each peice a unique material!

#### Evidence

#### Reflection
> Again, I learned how to use OnShape more effectively inw ays such as...
> - Use the USE tool whenever you can.  You already have the things constructed, so no need to make a new one.
> - AGain, when placing Fillets, select the fillet functions, select the entities to fillet, and than all at one select insert or generate.
> - By sketching on differnt planes (which on this case required sketches on 3 different planes) you can maximize simplicity and capability. 

> All of these things will be things that I can use as applicable info in the future.

## Wheels and Bearings

#### Description
> No skateboard is fun to ride without wheels, so I created a new part studion and went to work.  In this assignment we siply constructed 2 rectanges that were connected to eachother using distance from the origin to make sure they were constryned.  From there the RESOLVE tool was really all that mattered, as we simple resolved the ractanages 360degrees to gove us that cricle or wheel like shape.  Thats the wheel, so now for the bearings.  We used the circles from the wheel amd estruded it as a separete thing as the first part of the bearing.  We than created a circle on the first bearing oart, extruded inward as to tae away, and than inserted a another circle which serves as almost a washer for the wheels.  Done, assign parts, assign material, put text on the wheel so you can see if it moves and completed.

#### Evidence
[Here is the wheels and bearings on OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/b867c8594dfd307c2c9359c4/w/6b746ecde74103470425d771/e/7d39d24da8ba58e05d75ac03)

#### Reflection
> Another cool assigment with yet more major takaways...
> - The resolute tool is your friend, do not try to extrude two ways to create something circular, simply sketch the shape on a plane and resolute.
> - I learned how the extrude remove function excists and how in that case when I needed to remove something to insert a bearing, use the extrude remove rather than creating a weird shape to begin with.
> When inserting text onto a design, simply sketch on desired face and enter sketch box with constraints.  done, quick, easy.

> This assignemnt was cool because it forced me to leave my confort zone and explore new functions.

## Putting it all together

#### Description
> Peronally I though that this was the easiest part, we simply used mate connectors which we have done hundreds of times and some like the wheels were resolute mates but for the most part they were just stright up, match the dots fastened mates.  The only thing thatwas new here was when selecing tings such as screws, you simply clciked on all of the screw or nut you wanted to insert and than selected the areas that you wanted to put them in and all at oce they were added rather than doing it one by one.  This was just so much easier and is a  more conveniant way to go about assemblings things such as those.  But after a few minutes of random parts and a few fastened mates, I have my SKATEBOARD!

#### Reflection
> This was pretty straight forward but again some major takaways for the future...
> - When inserting base, set about the origine so you have one defined part.
> - When inserting things such as screws or nuts, do not do it one by one, pick all spots and insert all once.
> - Make sure that mates such as ones for wheels are resolute so they can turn.

> Skateboard complete!
