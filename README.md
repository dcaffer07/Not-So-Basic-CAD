### Intro (Purpose of these assignments) 

> In this unit i'm going to model a skateboard. First, I will get started with the deck, and then eventually I will design the whole thing! Along the way we will refresh our knowlegde oof how to operate OnShape and we will also introduce ourselves to new functions in order to expand our knowledge to make us better engineers.  The goal with this is to remind ourself of how to use this so that we can combind our knowledge of code with CAD to create something cool!

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Designing the Deck

#### Description
> Every skatboard needs a deck, and so we will design this fisrt and it will serve as a base for assignemnts in the future.  All in all this was really simple, simply sketch a 2D shape about the origon with the given dimentoions of a rectangle ad two symetric semi cricles connected to there.  From there we extrude the sketch and begin to draw holes on the face of the extrude which we will later cut through.  Finall we add fillets to the 8 holes (holes were again symetric) to clean the design up.  Add a cool color and DONE!

#### Evidence

#### Reflection
> Although I could have easily done this on my own, the module tuaght me more efficent ways to go about thin in onshape. For example last year I would have likely created 2 circles on each side however with this I simply used the symetry function and it was so much easier.  Another example of this would be with the circles where I simply created two linear patterns to get them in the right spot raher than dong each one individually.  All in all I think it refreshed my mind and got me back in the groove!

## Designing the Trucks

#### Description
> This assignemnt was kind of split into two pieces, designing the truck baseplate and designing the truck hanger. We first created a new part and began t sketch the main par of the baseball on the bottom of the deck and than we simply extruded.  We than used the use tool to create the other two peices of the base plate by again just using the original dimentions with some small adjustmants than extruding.  We than created the actuall truck by drawing a 2 concentric circles and extruding.  However at this point we need something to connect the two since we have a truck floating in mid air.  This is where the hanger came in, and we simply usedstuff we had previously defined extrude peices which would connect them.  from here it was more filleting for cleaning up purposes and bam, we are done with this section. Oh and we assigned each peice a unique material!

#### Reflection
> Again, could I have done this by my self? yes, but this step-by-step walk through allowed for me to check my work and go about it in a more effecient and cntrolled manner which just expanded my tool kit for future endeavors.  In this step the USE tool and fillet tools were essential and allowed for me to use thigs I had previously fabricated to create this just making my life sooo much easier in the long run.

## Wheels and Bearings

#### Description
> No skateboard is fun to ride without wheels, so I created a new part studion and went to work.  In this assignment we siply constructed 2 rectanges that were connected to eachother using distance from the origin to make sure they were constryned.  From there the RESOLVE tool was really all that mattered, as we simple resolved the ractanages 360degrees to gove us that cricle or wheel like shape.  Thats the wheel, so now for the bearings.  We used the circles from the wheel amd estruded it as a separete thing as the first part of the bearing.  We than created a circle on the first bearing oart, extruded inward as to tae away, and than inserted a another circle which serves as almost a washer for the wheels.  Done, assign parts, assign material, put text on the wheel so you can see if it moves and completed.

#### Evidence

#### Reflection
> Again I enjoyed this assigment as it allowed me to incorporate new things such as resolote into my build.  To be honest this really easy, and the hardest thing for me was putting text on the wheel to see if it would turn, but once I figured that our with some help I was all set, wheel and bearings done and its time to assemble!

## Putting it all together

### Description
> Peronally I though that this was the easiest part, we simply used mate connectors which we have done hundreds of times and some like the wheels were resolute mates but for the most part they were just stright up, match the dots fastened mates.  The only thing thatwas new here was when selecing tings such as screws, you simply clciked on all of the screw or nut you wanted to insert and than selected the areas that you wanted to put them in and all at oce they were added rather than doing it one by one.  This was just so much easier and is a  more conveniant way to go about assemblings things such as those.  But after a few minutes of random parts and a few fastened mates, I have my SKATEBOARD!

### Evidence

### Reflection
> This was a really cool assignment.  I have always been more of a CAD kind of person and this was great, partially because it was not overly complicated, but mainly because unlike the caster(no offence and I loved the caster assgnemnt), we can actually use something like this inreal life and it is something that we are all interested.  I thought thatThis was a perfect assignment to get back into it and I look forward to what the future holds!!!!!!!!!
